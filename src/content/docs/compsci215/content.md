COMPSCI215 is a very thereocial heavy course, as such this wiki will try its best to cover **everything**.
The following content is based of Ulrich slides.

## Types of networks 

- The internet is made up of:
    - Local Area Networks (LANs)
    - Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)
    - Wide Area Networks (WANs)
    - Backbone / backhaul networks

- Personal Area Networks (e.g Bluetooth)

And more!
COMPSCI will be focusing on the Internet and its networks

## Basic netwokring componenets

- Nodes and hosts
- Interfaces
- Links

### What is a host and a node?
- A Host is a device connected to a network that is in some way involved in applications
- Examples:
    - Computers, smartphones, tablets
    - Network devices such as routers if they offer applications (such as configuration via the network)
        - Routers or switches that just forward packets don't count as hosts, they're just nodes

Every host is a node, but **not** every node is a host.

### Interfaces
- An interface is the technical device by which a node connects to a network.
- Every host needs at least one interface.
- Examples:
    - Ethernet
    - USB
    - WiFi
    And so on
### Links
- A link enables the exchange of information between two interfaces.
- Examples:
    - Ethernet: Cable
    - WiFi: Same radio range
