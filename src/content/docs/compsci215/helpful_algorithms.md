title: Helpful Algorithms
---

As you might know, the test and exam for this course have a lot of time
pressure. In addition, they don't actually assess the content itself, but
your brain's computational power. Because of this, learning these algorithms
will give you a massive advantage in the test and exam.

This is a list of algorithms not covered by the lectures that are really
helpful for the test and exam. It is a good idea to have practise with these.

## List of Common Algorithms to Learn

These algorithms can be easily leaned on the intenet, as they are well known,
and many people study and optimise them.

* Fast modular exponentiation (by squaring) - helpful for the RSA and
diffie-hellman questions.
* Euclidean algorithm - computes the GCD (greatest common divisor) of two
integers.
* Extended Euclidean algorithm - helpful to quickly compute modular inverses.

## Exam-Specific

These algorithms are not as common, and are specific to the types of questions you might get on the exam.
