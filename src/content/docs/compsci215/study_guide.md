**This page contains the things you need to learn for the Mid Sem Test**

In order to do well in the mid-semester test, you need to be able to:

- Identify network components as hosts, interfaces, links, nodes, switches and
  routers and be able to apply the definitions.
- Recognise and interpret different network topologies, including star, line, ring,
  bus, mesh and mixed topologies, and be able to identify which hosts will have
  connectivity should a given link or interface fail.
- Confirm or reject statements on these topologies as true or false.
- Confirm or reject statements on protocols as true or false.
- Determine whether a simple protocol is complete and unambiguous and identify
  what the protocol needs to achieve completeness and correctness.
- Confirm or reject statements on physical layer protocols as true or false.
- Give alternative interpretations of signals based on timing prescriptions in a
  protocol.
- Confirm or reject statements on physical layers with repeaters as true or false.
- Confirm or reject statements on the behaviour of hubs and switches as true or
  false.
- Identify which frames are seen or forwarded on which ports on a switch or hub
  under which circumstances.
- Populate a switching table given a list of frames sent to the switch.
- Identify potential problems in the connection of multiple switches.
- Confirm or reject statements on framing in different data link layers for different
  physical layers as true or false.
- Confirm or reject statements on data link layer addressing as true or false.
- Recognise MAC addresses in different formats.
- Confirm or reject statements on MAC addresses as true or false.
- Recognise which transmissions on a shared medium will collide given
  transmission times, durations, and propagation times.
- Confirm or reject statements on CSMA/CD as true or false.
- Confirm or reject statements on data link layer tasks such as media access
  control, error detection and correction, local flow control etc. as true or false.
- Determine the RTT of frame and packets given transmission and propagation
  time information.
- Confirm or reject statements on the use of RTT in error recovery as true or false.
- Apply the concepts of transmission time, propagation time and effective data
  rate to given communication scenarios.
- Confirm or reject statements on the use of ACKs in error recovery as true or false.
- Confirm or reject statements on IP addresses as true or false.
- Distinguish between netmasks and IP addresses.
- Convert IP addresses and netmasks from binary to dotted decimal format and
  vice versa.
- Identify netid and hostid given an IPv4 address and a netmask or a CIDR suffix.
- Identify the network address of a given IPv4 address with a netmask or CIDR
  suffix.
- Identify the local broadcast address of a network from a given IPv4 address with
  a netmask or CIDR suffix.
- Identify the theoretical size (capacity) of the network from a given IPv4 address
  with a netmask or CIDR suffix.
- Use a netmask and a network address to determine whether a given IP address is
  part of a network or not.
- Identify which MAC and IP addresses are used at different stages of an IP packet
  journey.
- Identify which MAC and IP addresses are used in which packets of DHCP
  transactions and of ARP requests and responses.
- Identify the order in which, and the MAC and IP addresses to which messages in
  DHCP are sent.
- Perform subnetting tasks similar to those in your assignment.
- Identify which route in a routing table will be used to forward an IP packet with a
  given destination IP address.
- Determine the TCP sequence numbers of packets given information on packet
  sizes and, where applicable, ACK numbers from the opposite side, in situations
  with and without packet loss.
- Determine the sequence and ACK numbers during the TCP connection
  handshake given an initial sequence number.
- Determine the ACK numbers in TCP connections before and after packet loss, as
  well as after retransmission.
- Determine the relative position and movement of pointers in TCP transmit and
  receive buffers following the writing, sending, receipt, acknowledgment and/or
  reading of data.
- Determine the minimum number of available buffer bytes at a receiver given ACK
  number, advertised window, and recent packet transmission history of the
  sender.
- Identify true and false statements on the sequence of events in recursive,
  iterative, and mixed DNS lookup scenarios.
- Identify the ports of commonly used protocols.
- Confirm or reject statements on the use of firewalls as true or false.
- Given simple firewall rules and packets, determine which packets will be
  forwarded and which ones will not.
