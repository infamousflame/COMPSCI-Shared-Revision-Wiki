# Code of Conduct

This shall be relatively short, as we expect every contributor to have a decent amount of common sense. Those who abuse the short and simple nature of this code of conduct may be prevented from contributing further.

## Standard of Behaviour

When contributing, you should:
* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the wiki
* Show empathy towards other contributors

Note that this list is not exhaustive.

## Inclusivity

We wish to foster an environment in which everyone is allowed to participate, provided they follow the rules.

To do this, the following should never be a factor in allowing or disallowing someone to participate:
* Level of experience
* Race, ethnicity or nationality
* Political or religious beliefs
* Gender or sexuality (or other aspects of sexual identity)

Note that this list is not exhaustive.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to anyone contributing to, promoting or otherwise representing the project. All standards in it must be applied to any project-related communications and any wiki content created.

This code of conduct is not legally binding, but is here to inform contributors of the expected behaviour and potential sanctions for any misbehaviour.

## Enforcement

We have several options to enforce this code of conduct, including declining a pull request or preventing you from contributing in the future. These decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, and will not necessarily appear to be deterministic.
