# Code of Conduct

This shall be relatively short, as we expect every contributor to have a decent amount of common sense. Those who abuse the short and simple nature of this code of conduct may be prevented from contributing further.

## Standard of Behaviour

When contributing, you should:
* Use welcoming and inclusive language.
* Be respectful of different viewpoints
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the wiki
* Show empathy towards other contributors

## Inclusivity

We wish to foster an environment in which everyone is allowed to participate, provided they follow the rules.

To do this, everyone should be able to participate regardless of:
* Level of experience
* Race, ethnicity or nationality
* Political or religious beliefs
* Gender or sexuality

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to anyone contributing to, promoting or otherwise representing the project. All standards in it must be applied to any project-related communications and any wiki content created.

## Enforcement

We have several options to enforce this code of conduct, including declining the pull request or preventing you from contributing in the future. These decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, and will not necessarily seem deterministic.
